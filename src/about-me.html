        <h2>Background and early life</h2>
        <p>I was born in the UK, and grew up in London. My parents are both from the Caribbean and 
        moved to England as young children.
        <br><br>

        I am the second oldest of 4 siblings and the first in our family to go to university.
        <br><br>
        I moved to Sydney in 2013 and have been here ever since. My family have visited many 
        times over the years but I'm still trying to persuade them to leave the cold grey weather behind and move here permanently!
