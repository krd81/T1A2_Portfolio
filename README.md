## Purpose of website
The purpose of the website is to provide an opportunity to practise and utilise the HTML and CSS skills we have learned. It also serves as a convenient way to showcase my work and abilities to potential future employers. As it is part of an assignment, it also provides the educators with a view of my capabilities at this stage of the course.

## Functionality/features
I have designed the webpage to be minimal in terms of background/images/fonts/colours etc. This is so that the content itself is the focus, rather than distractions around too many images or lots of different colours or shapes.

I wanted a plain/light background, and a font style that embodies a warm and welcoming feel, so chose one that is very rounded, and not angular or sharp looking and sans serif, which automatically makes it more simple. The background and font style are used on every page allowing for continuity and consistency, which also helps the viewer to have a sense of calm while navigating the pages that everything looks and feels the way they are expecting.

The header of each page has a navigation bar which contains links to each of the pages. The bar is responsive to hovering, and so the background changes colour and the hyperlink becomes white to give some visual feedback to the user. By including this bar on each page, it becomes very easy to navigate back and forth or journey through the website in the user's own chosen path.

The homepage is very simple with minimal scrolling required to reach the contact section at the bottom. This is a clearly defined section with a different background colour and the links to the various means of making contact a call to action for anyone visiting the page.

The website is fully responsive with fonts and elements, resized or with altered layouts depending on the device being used.

The external links have been created so that they open in a new browser window, so that the user does not inadvertently leave the website when going to view github or the resume for example.
